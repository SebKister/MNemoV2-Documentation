# BASIC Mode Clicks


This is a new feature introduced in v2.5.4

Whereas the BASIC mode uses long clicks to validate the main commands you can use shorter click combinations for auxiliary actions in BASIC mode:
- You can **add a marker** ![marker.png](marker.png) with a unique ID to a station: 

    **LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-RIGHT**
  > Markers will appear on the live map with their unique ID
- You can display the live **survey map**:

    **LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT**
- You can access the **[LRUD](LRUD.md)** entry mode:

    **RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT-LEFT**
