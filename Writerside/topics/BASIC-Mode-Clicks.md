# BASIC Mode Click Commands


_This is a new feature introduced in v2.5.4_

Whereas the BASIC mode uses long clicks to validate the main commands you can use shorter click combinations for auxiliary actions in BASIC mode:

- You can **add a marker** ![marker.png](marker.png) with a unique ID to a station: 

    **LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-RIGHT**
  > Markers will appear on the live map with their unique ID
- You can display the live **survey map**:

    **LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT**
- You can access the **[LRUD](LRUD.md)** entry mode:

    **RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT-LEFT**
- You can select the _survey direction_ as **IN** :

    **LEFT-LEFT-LEFT-LEFT**
 
- You can select the _survey direction_ as **OUT** :

    **RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT-RIGHT**
> Changing the survey direction can only be done while in Stand By ( Green ) mode

> In Basic mode when you do short clicks you'll notice dots appearing at the top of the screen, RED for left clicks and GREEN for right, they are here to help you enter click commands
