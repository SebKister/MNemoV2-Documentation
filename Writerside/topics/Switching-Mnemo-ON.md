# Switching Mnemo ON 

There's no **ON/OFF** switch on the device. You'll switch the device ON using the slider control described in the previous section.

- Move the slider control to the **left** and hold it there until a led turns on, on the right side of the screen. At that moment move the slider to the right and the device will turn on displaying info about the firmware and the serial number of the device.
>Tip: If you can’t see the led just count to 6 before moving the slider to the right.
- When this appears, it means MNemo has booted properly, and all the sensors are working.
  Move again the slider to the left and you’ll be in the main menu.
>Tip: You can deactivate the requirement to move the cursor to the right with the *SwitchONSafety* setting.
