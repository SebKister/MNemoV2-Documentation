# Firmware Update

- Download the [latest firmware](https://github.com/SebKister/Mnemo-V2/releases) on Github ( Itâ€™s a file with a .UF2 extension)
- Connect the device to your computer and go to:

**OPTIONS > SETTINGS > UPDATE**


> The device should appear in your file explorer as a USB Memory stick would.

- Simply copy the firmware file you downloaded there. That should trigger a reboot of the Mnemo and install the new firmware.
- After updating the firmware, disconnect from the computer and turn off the MNemo. 
> The next time you turn the Mnemo on the new firmware will be fully functional.
