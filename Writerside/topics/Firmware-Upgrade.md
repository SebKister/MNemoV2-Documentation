# Firmware Update
## Automatic update ##

With the introduction of [MNemoLink v1.4.0](https://github.com/SebKister/MNemoLink/releases/latest), the firmware process has been simplified.
When you connect the device to the computer and open MNemoLink, the application will look if a new version of the firmware is available.

If so, it will allow you to update the firmware automatically to the latest version by pressing the yellow update button. 

## Manual update ##

- Download the [latest firmware](https://github.com/SebKister/Mnemo-V2/releases) on Github ( Itâ€™s a file with a .UF2 extension)
- Connect the device to your computer and go to:

**OPTIONS > SETTINGS > UPDATE**


> The device should appear in your file explorer as a USB Memory stick would.

- Simply copy the firmware file you downloaded there. That should trigger a reboot of the Mnemo and install the new firmware.
- After updating the firmware, disconnect from the computer and turn off the MNemo. 
> The next time you turn the Mnemo on the new firmware will be fully functional.
