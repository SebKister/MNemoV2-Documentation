# MnemoLink - Data Transfer

The Mnemo v2 is supported on Microsoft Windows(>7), Apple Mac OSX (>10.6) and Linux (Kernel >5.0.0)

Currently there’s no driver installation required for the Mnemo v2 on any of the supported operating system.

MNemoLink is the software that interfaces your Mnemo v2 with your computer,
allows the download of the data as well as the visualization of the survey.
It also allows to adjust certain settings that are not available on the Mnemo menu.

You can download the software [here](https://www.arianesline.com/mnemo/)

Turn on MNemo. At that point your computer should have recognized the device.

## Launch MNemoLink ##
At this point you can launch MnemoLink application on your computer.

> If “Mnemo not detected” appears in the right corner, make sure the connector is properly placed on the Mnemo 
and the device is turned ON than press the refresh button in the middle of MNemoLink's window.

If the connection is successful, you should have the serial number of your device displayed in the upper right corner.

The **Data** tab will give you options to _download_ and _save the survey data contained_ on
the MNemo as DMP and various other formats that you can use in your favorite survey software.

The **Setting** tab will give you access to different settings of the Mnemo that are not accessible through the settings Menu.
Most of those are self explanatory. The ones locked are factory settings that should not be modified.
MNemoLink will save the data on the device in an Excel sheet. You can then copy-paste it in your favorite mapping software.

The **CLI** tab is for advanced command line based interaction with the MNemo.
