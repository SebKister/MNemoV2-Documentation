# Memory management

Mnemo can save around 5000 measures.
You can see the amount of memory used on the bottom bar in the main menu.

You can erase the memory by going to:
**OPTIONS > SETTINGS > MEMORY**

> We recommend downloading the data from the MNemo after each survey session, backing up the data as DMP and erasing the data from the device in order to start next session with an empty memory.
