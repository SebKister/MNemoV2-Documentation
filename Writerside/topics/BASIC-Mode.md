>From now on you don´t need to be able  to read what’s displayed on the screen. The color alone will give you information on which phase of the survey you are in.

> In BASIC mode the slider button doesn’t work by impulses, you’ll have to hold the slider during a certain amount of time ( more or less 2s) to give and validate a command.
> A red progress bar on the top screen will show the progress, the order only gets validated once the  progress bar is complete.
