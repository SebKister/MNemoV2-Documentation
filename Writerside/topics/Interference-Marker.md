# Interference Marker

During your survey, if you see an icon of a magnet flashing on your screen, that means the device has detected a magnetic interference.

That flashing will only last for 5s, when it stops it doesnâ€™t mean the problem is gone, just that you were warned.
In such a case make sure that no part of your equipment has magnets or other elements that could strongly interfere with the compass.
