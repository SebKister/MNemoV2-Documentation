**OPTIONS > EXTRAS**

You’ll find a list of Tools

- **GAUGE**: A depth gauge indicating depth and absolute pressure
- **TEST**: A mode to test the reading of all sensors, pressure, magnetometer, inclinometer etc
- **ONE-GO(OFF)**: _NOT DOCUMENTED, leave on OFF_
- **WIFI_AP(OFF)**: When turned on the device will create a Wireless Access Point _( SSID: **Mnemo** Passord: **password**)_  to directly read the data on the Mnemo without the need of a local wireless network.
- **MAGNETO** : Magnetic analysis tool 

You can use the Magneto feature to analysis how strongly your dive equipment affects magnetic reading.

> The earth magnetic fields goes from 25uT to 65uT depending on your location.

By moving the Mnemo closer or further from your equipment you’ll get a reading of the strength of the magnetic field that is created.
- Here you can see that the magnetic field is between 32.92 and 33.44 when the device is left without any outside disturbance<

- When we move a dive light around the Mnemo the magnetic field is this time fluctuating between 30.55 and 37.49 which is a huge difference !
