# Surveying - The big picture -

An important thing to remember is that once you are using MNemo it is not necessary to read the display for each operation. The color will indicate the operational phase.
Familiarity with MNemo allows your focus to be on the safety of your dive and a global cave/environment awareness. BASIC mode makes it even easier, we recommend that mode for all your surveys.


With a bit of practice you can survey at the same speed youâ€™d normally swim in a cave (15-20m/min).
