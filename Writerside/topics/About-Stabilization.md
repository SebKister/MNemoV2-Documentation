# About Stabilization

In which ever survey mode you use the Mnemo the **stabilization** phase is indicated by **RED background color**.

If during stabilization the red background starts flashing, that means the device is not flat enough ( ie. rolling too much on one side or the other ). In this case rotate the device around the line until the blinking stops, then stay stable and the measure will be taken.

The rotation tolerance is quite large ( about 30ยบ on each side of the line) so this should not be a major issue.
