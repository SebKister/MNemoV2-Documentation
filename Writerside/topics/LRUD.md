# LRUD ( Cave Profile description)

You can enter LRUD ( Left-Right-Up-Down) measurement (or estimation) values to describe the corridor section of the cave at each station.

- In Verbose survey mode this is done by going to 


    **OPTIONS > SETTINGS > LRUD(LIST or INC)**

    - _**INC**_ : In this mode the numerical value will increase gradually. It is the slowest of the two mode but allows to enter precise values
    - **_LIST_** : In this mode the numerical value will increase according to a predetermined set of length. It's the fastest mode and typically the one used when value are estimated rather than measured.

- In BASIC Mode, you enter the LRUD menu when you are on the READY screen ( the one with WHITE background) with a click combination:

    **LEFT-RIGHT-LEFT-RIGHT**

Once you are on the LRUD entry screen you increase the value moving the cursor left and go to the next value moving it right.
