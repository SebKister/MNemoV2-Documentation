# Survey Operations

The Mnemo has two survey mode, you can select which one you preferably want to use in 

**OPTIONS > SETTINGS > SURVEY ( BASIC _or_ Verbose)**

- **BASIC** : This is the recommended survey mode. It does not require from you to read the display, just recognise the background color.
- **Verbose** _(legacy - it will be removed in future versions of the firmware)_ This one is easier to start with and offers some options not available in BASIC mode. It requires to have the ability to read the text on the LCD.
