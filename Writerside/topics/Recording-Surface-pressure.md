# Recording the surface pressure

The device calculates the depth by measuring the variation of pressure between the surface and where it is located under water.
Therefore it needs to have a reference measurement of the surface pressure.
This can be done by navigating to :

**OPTIONS > SENSORS > DEPTH > SURFACE**


Once you get the _CALIBRATED_ message on the screen that means the device recorded the current atmospheric pressure as reference.
> This needs to be recalibrated mainly when diving at altitude or diving during extreme weather conditions


>Obviously â€¦  **_DO NOT ADJUST SURFACE PRESSURE IN THE WATER_**
