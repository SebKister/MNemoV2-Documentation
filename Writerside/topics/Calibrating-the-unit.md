# Calibrating the unit

Before starting a survey MNemoâ€™s sensors need to be calibrated and certain parameters need to be adjusted

- Setting the units used by MNemo ( Meter or feet)
- Selecting the type of water you are diving in ( Fresh or Salt )
- Adjusting the surface pressure
- Adjusting the line measurement factor
- Calibrating the Compass
>**All the settings and calibration are kept in memory when you turn MNemo off.** 
> _This is a major difference with Mnemo v1 that required calibration of the compass for each session._
