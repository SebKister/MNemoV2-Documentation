# Maintenance

- Do not let the battery drain completely. Put it on charge ( leave connected to your computer or other USB charger)  once per month even if you donâ€™t use the device.
- After each use thoroughly rinse MNemo with fresh water, do not use any other chemical product. Ideally have MNemo clipped on a piece of line and move it forward and backward so that the wheel gets cleaned everywhere as well. Also move the pressure plate lever while washing.
- If you have the feeling there still is sediment trapped in the base of the device or in the screen cover, you can unscrew both parts to clean them directly.
