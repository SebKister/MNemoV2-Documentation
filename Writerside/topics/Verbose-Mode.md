# Verbose Mode (legacy) 

## Starting a survey
From the main menu select **SURVEY**
The screen will display options similar to:

![nameverbose.jpg](nameverbose.jpg){width=200}

In this menu you can choose the name of the section you are surveying.

_Section_ in this case means the section of the survey which can differ from the section of the cave you are working in. 

In our example the section is called AA1. You can navigate from one letter to the other moving the slider to the right and change the current letter by moving the slider to the left. Once done select OK.

The menu will display two options, select which direction you are surveying, IN or OUT.
- **IN** means you are going from already surveyed stations to new ones 
- **OUT** means you are coming from new stations going towards already known ones.

>NOTE : The reference shot that you had in Mnemo v1 are no longer used in v2

## Surveying a shot

To survey a shot:
- pull the pressure plate lever
- insert the line into the slot
- release the lever
- make sure the line is not trapped
- slide the device to the beginning of the shot ( Entry Station)

Select **START**

![menuhori.jpg](menuhori_1.jpg){width=200}

The display will show a RED square: 

![stabilizeVerbose.jpg](stabilizeVerbose.jpg){width=200}


**_At that point the device is waiting to be stabilized to measure the azimuth._**

> **THE ONE THING TO REMEMBER FROM THIS USER MANUAL:**
> Don’t hold the device in your hand, rather support it from beneath so it can use the tension in the line to self align and take the most accurate measurement possible.

The display shows a blue or purple square with a dot in it when the compass has measured the first azimuth.

You can now move the device along the line all the way to the next station.
The display will be flickering that BLUE/PURPLE square indicating that the wheel is spinning and measuring the length of the line.
The device measures the line in both direction allowing you to compensate for big diameter tie-offs. 
_If the line is too loose the length reading will be incorrect._


> You can use Mnemo v2 in reverse direction of the engraved arrow, the device will 	automatically reverse the azimuth
>
>
>If the device is flickering BLUE/RED that means it has been dragged along the line before the stabilization phase was over, you should start the survey of that shot again.

When you reach the next station, select **STOP**

The display turns red waiting to stabilize and measure the second azimuth.

**Repeat the operation …**

Once you reached the last shot of your section select **END**

This will save the section. You are back to the main menu ready to survey the next section !
